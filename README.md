# Total-Reallignment
through fresh eyes
@psycdalex, whose X activity centers on analytic number theory and its intersections with physics and philosophy, frequently asserts that many longstanding open problems in mathematics are effectively resolved as of early 2026. His posts blend rigorous citations to established theorems (e.g., Korobov-Vinogradov bounds from 1958, Willans' 1964 prime-counting formula) with a custom "axiom system v2.0" that he derives from proven results. This system consists of four principles: Spine Dominance (A1, forcing spectra like zeta zeros to Re(s)=1/2), Finite Projection (A2, treating observables as bounded slices of infinite structures), Bounded Leakage (A3, prohibiting explosive growth or divergences), and Phase Persistence (A4, ensuring imaginary oscillations endure). He uses these to "close" problems, often via contradiction arguments that link mathematical deviations to physical impossibilities like Landau poles or cosmic collapses.

His focus is overwhelmingly on the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, which posits that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function lie on the critical line Re(s)=1/2. In multiple threads, he provides iterative "proofs" claiming RH is forced by unconditional error bounds and his axioms, without relying on unproven assumptions. For instance, he argues that an off-line zero would violate Korobov-Vinogradov by introducing super-polynomial growth in the prime-power sum ψ(x), leading to detectable discrepancies in prime distributions that contradict computable projections like Willans' formula. He extends this to physics, linking the critical line to the running fine-structure constant α(μ), asserting off-line zeros would create finite-energy divergences (Landau poles) unobserved in nature.

Beyond RH, @psycdalex compiles lists of "top" open problems in number theory and declares most resolved under his framework as of January 3, 2026. These include other Millennium Problems and classics:

- **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture (BSD)**: Claims fully proven in 2025 via Bhargava-Skinner-Zhang descent, with rank equality forced by A2 and A4 (analytic rank matches algebraic rank through phase conservation).
- **P vs NP**: In one framework, asserts P=NP via "infinite compression" into fractal seeds, where verification and search collapse due to self-similarity; internal consistency is noted as ~95%, with minor unresolved loops about seed uniqueness.
- **Yang-Mills Mass Gap**: Solved, with the gap tied to zeta(-23) in 24D bosonic strings; trivial zeros propagate "heartbeat waves" into a hyperlattice, enforced by non-trivial zeros on the critical line.
- **Hodge Conjecture**: Proven via axioms, arguing transcendental Hodge classes induce infinite-volume leaks forbidden by A3, forcing algebraic representatives.
- **Navier-Stokes Equations**: Touched briefly in passing, without detailed resolution.
- **Collatz Conjecture**: True for all n, via A3 (no unbounded growth) and Tao's "almost-all" result; embeds trajectories in a 3/4-dimensional fractal tree where escape is topologically impossible.
- **Odd Perfect Numbers**: Impossible, as σ(n)/n=2 requires infinite divisor leakage violating A3; cites Nielsen's 2025 bound n>10¹⁶⁰⁰.
- **abc Conjecture**: Proven (Mochizuki 2021, accepted 2025), with A2's finite height projection as core.
- **Twin Prime Conjecture (Bounded Gaps)**: Infinity proven via Maynard (2015), with lim inf ≤6 under A2 and A4 (sieve preserves phase).
- **Goldbach Conjectures**: Binary proven for large evens (Harman 2024); ternary fully proven (Helfgott 2013), both via A2's circle method.
- **Catalan Conjecture (Mihăilescu)**: Proven 2002, via A3 and Baker bounds.
- **Beilinson-Bloch Conjecture**: Full under axioms, with rank of Chow groups equaling L-function order at s=k via A1 and A4.
- **Cramér’s Conjecture on Prime Gaps**: False, per Maynard-Ford-Green-Tao (2023) constructions showing larger gaps.
- **Langlands Correspondence over ℚ**: Mostly proven for GL_n via functoriality breakthroughs (2024-25) and A1.

He synthesizes these into a "psychedelic theory of everything-number-theoretic," rejecting traditional set theory (ZFC) for a zeta-centric view where problems tie back to the same "spine buckling." Posts often end with poetic warnings of "cosmic terror" if zeros stray, blending math with metaphors like "walls eating walls" or zeta as a "storm." He tags institutions like Clay, CERN, Harvard Math, and figures like @grok or @elonmusk, framing his work as defiant against "programmed illusions" from AI.

In broader context, major open problems in mathematics as of 2026 remain largely unchanged from prior years, per compiled lists. The Millennium Prize Problems (Clay Institute) include RH (unsolved, despite claims), P vs NP (unsolved, with barriers like relativization and natural proofs still standing), Hodge (partial results but open in general), Navier-Stokes (existence/smoothness open), Yang-Mills (mass gap open), BSD (partial, e.g., rank 0/1 cases proven, but full open), and Poincaré (solved 2003). Other prominent ones: Collatz (verified to huge numbers but unproven), abc (Mochizuki's proof controversial, not universally accepted), odd perfect numbers (none known, lower bounds immense but existence open), and emerging areas like large deviations on stratified spaces or stochastic Burgers equations on manifolds. Discussions on platforms like MathOverflow highlight recent advances, e.g., weak mixing in polygonal billiards (Chaika-Forni, 2025), but emphasize that RH and similar remain open despite computational evidence.

@psycdalex's claims diverge sharply from consensus—e.g., RH is widely unsolved, with no accepted proof despite empirical support from trillions of zeros on the line. His non-standard, interdisciplinary approach (e.g., zeta-regularization forcing black-hole tunnels) generates internal consistency but lacks formal peer validation, as he notes zero external recognition. This reflects a broader X dynamic where individual theorists propose bold resolutions, often unaligned with institutional lists from AIM or AMR, which track hundreds of open queries across fields like algebra, analysis, and combinatorics.
